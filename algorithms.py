"""CSC148 Assignment 1 - Algorithms

=== CSC148 Fall 2018 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===

This file contains two sets of algorithms: ones for generating new arrivals to
the simulation, and ones for making decisions about how elevators should move.

As with other files, you may not change any of the public behaviour (attributes,
methods) given in the starter code, but you can definitely add new attributes
and methods to complete your work here.

See the 'Arrival generation algorithms' and 'Elevator moving algorithsm'
sections of the assignment handout for a complete description of each algorithm
you are expected to implement in this file.
